# Artificial Intelligence
The purpose of this project is to implement a simple program of Artificial Intelligence to solve a problem in two different ways. The first way is by using Python and the second by using Clips. 
This project was part of a course I did in my 5th semester.

## Prerequisites

To use the files in this repository, you will need the following:
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the first implemantation.
2. [CLIPS](https://clipsrules.net/) for the second implementation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the source code file using the appropriate compiler. 

## Contents
This repository contains the following files:
1. Source_Code.py
2. Source_Code_For_Testing.py
3. Tests_File.py
6. Source_Code_v2.2.clp

## Specifications

### Functionality

A parking lot that works automatically,
it has one operating level with n parking spaces
(spaces), numbered from S_1 to S_n, delimited to
plane as shown in Figure A (grey colored rectangles
for n=4). The first of the sites, S1, is located at
facade and is designated as a reception area. Also,
there are (n-1) car drop platforms
(platforms), numbered from P_1 to P_(n-1) and are
placed one by one in n-1 parking spaces. At the beginning
operation of the problem, the parking lot is empty from
cars (all platforms empty, P_1 â€“ P_(n-1)=empty),
and in the reception area there is no deposit platform
(S_1=empty) as shown in Figure A for n=4 ). Finally, at the beginning of the problem, there are 3
cars waiting to enter the parking lot.
The car park has an automatic navigation system to regulate the entry process. So that he can
for a car to enter the parking lot, the autopilot should ensure that there is one
free platform in the reception area, and deposit a car that is waiting
entry on this platform. Each platform can carry a maximum of one car.
The navigator can move a platform from the space it is in to an adjacent space as long as it is sufficient
this one should be empty. For example, in the initial state, the input space S_1 may
the platform P_1 is moved and the space S_2 on which it was located becomes empty, or
platform P_3 is moved by changing the corresponding space S_4 to empty, but platform P_2 is not
can be transferred. Each ported platform can be either free or not (ie
occupied by a car).
